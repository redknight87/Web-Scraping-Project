This is our code for our webscraping project. The project can be divided into two parts: <br><br>
Part 1: We web scraped from Indeed.com the top 200 data science jobs in Los Angeles, CA. For each link, we recorded the job's title, company, city location, and job description. Furthermore, we searched each job description if it contained technical skills such as C, C++, Java, Javascript, Python, R, SQL, Hadoop, Hive, Pig, Spark, Amazon Web Services, and Tableau. To determine which is the most common technical skill among data scientists, we counted the frequencies of each keyword in the dataframe.  
  <br>
 Part 2: We web scraped from Indeed.com the top 50 popular companies for Data Scientists in Los Angeles, CA. We recorded the company's name, the reviewer's job title, the title of the review, the review rating, the data of the review, the review content, pros and cons.
